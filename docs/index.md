Data processing pipeline for a nucleate pool boiling apparatus.

## Overview

The [data process graph](#data-process-graph) shows the data process, and allows for individual steps in the process to be defined indpendently as Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or even in other languages like Matlab. The process is defined in `dvc.yaml` as as series of "stages". Each stage has dependencies and outputs. This structure allows the data process graph to be constructed, directly from the `dvc.yaml` file. This separates the concerns of data management, process development, and pipeline orchestration. This project reflects the application of data science best practices to modern engineering wokflows.

## Usage

If you would like to adopt this approach to processing your own data, you may clone this repository and begin swapping configs and logic for your own, or use a similar architecture for your data processing. To run a working example with some actual data from this study, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repository and open it in your terminal or IDE (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/blakeNaccarato/boilerdata.git boilerdata`).
2. Navigate to the clone directory in a terminal window (e.g. `cd boilerdata`).
3. Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment (e.g. `py -3.10 -m venv .venv` on Windows w/ Python 3.10 installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)).
4. Activate the virtual environment (e.g. `.venv/scripts/activate` on Windows).
5. Run `pip install --editable .` to install `boilerdata` package in an editable fashion. This step may take awhile.
6. Delete the top-level `data` and `config` directories, then copy the `config` and `data` folders inside of `tests/data` to the root directory.
7. Copy the `.propshop` folder in `tests/data/.propshop` to your user-folder (e.g. `C:/Users/<you>/.propshop` on Windows).
8. Run `dvc repro metrics` to execute the data process up to that stage.

The data process should run the following stages: `axes`, `modelfun`, `runs`, `parse_benchmarsk`, `pipeline`, and `metrics`. Some stages are skipped because we specified to run just the necessary stages up to `metrics` (the example data doesn't currently include the literature data). You may inspect the actual code that runs during these stages in `src/boilerdata/stages`, e.g. `pipeline.py` contains the logic for the `pipeline` stage. This example happens to use Python scripts, but you could define a stage in `dvc.yaml` that instead runs Matlab scripts, or any arbitrary action. This approach allows for the data process to be reliably reproduced over time, and for the process to be easily modified and extended in a collaborative effort.

There are other details of this process, such as the hosting of data in the `data` folder in a Google Cloud Bucket (alternatively it can be hosted on Google Drive), and more. This has to do with the need to store data (especially large datasets) outside of the repository, and access it in an authenticated fashion.

## Data process graph

This data process graph is derived from the structure of the code itself. It is automatically generated by [dvc](https://dvc.org/). This self-documenting process improves reproducibility and reduces documentation overhead.
